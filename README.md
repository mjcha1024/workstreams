# workstreams
Experiment on workstream-based architecture of task management




# Tasks:

do: function startInterface()
do: worklet initialization: data is loaded after initialization (overrides initial values)
do: data is saved after modification
do: ensure that current to-do list cycle format is preserved
do: getNextBase(): recursively traverse through dependency tree until there is a base task that doesn't have a dependency
do: basic prototype
doc: worklets: original data is immutable (only edited by hand)
